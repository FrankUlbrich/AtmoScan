IMPORTANT

The V2 schematic has been tested by modifying a V1 PCB and it works. The V2 PCB has been routed but has not been manufactured. I was happy enough with the modded V1. 
However i thought that if someone wanted to make Atmoscan from scratrch, it would be a good idea to provide the latest schematic with a companion PCB.
THEREFORE... before sending it blindly to your manufacturer of choice, I suggest you double check it.
Please contact me should you find any glitches. 
Happy soldering!
